You’ve just started a new gig as a physical security penetration tester, and your latest job makes use of a laser tripwire system. 
Being more on the brains than brawn side of the spectrum, you decide not to risk trying to maneuver through the lasers, and instead 
to divert them using a clever collection of mirrors you recently acquired so that you can just walk through.

Conveniently, the facility only makes use of lasers which shoot straight across the room horizontally – no funny angles. 
You therefore set all of your mirrors to 45 degrees and get to work. You will need to create an area free of the laser at least 
6 feet tall by 2 feet wide, for example as shown in the image below. The room is 12 feet wide and 10 feet tall. It is convenient 
to think of the room as a 12×10 grid. There may be obstacles on the ceiling of varying sizes (but always conforming to the grid), 
making the job a bit more difficult. You also only have 8 mirrors (each of which fits perfectly in, and occupies an entire, 1×1 grid 
space).

n Prolog you will create a program which automatically figures out where the mirrors should be placed, given a height of laser emitter, 
and the coordinates of obstacles on the ceiling. You must output where these mirrors will go.
