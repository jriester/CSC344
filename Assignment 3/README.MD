This program performs pattern matching on strings in Scala, where patterns are expressed using only the concatenation, alternation("|"),
optional("?") operators of regular expressions, and the tokens are letters and digits, plus period to mean any letter. ach run of the 
program should accept a pattern, and then any number of strings, reporting only whether they match.
