Write a Python program that collects, summarizes, and e-mails all the programming assignments for this course. Each program was accessed, gathering information such as: Name of each source file and how  many lines long the file is, a list of all identifiers used in the program (class, function, rule, variables, etc.).

HTML pages were created using Python which linked to each of the source filed and hosted zip files which contained the scraped information above.
